How to use AVENGERS ASSEMBLED!
This book contains descriptions of all
the heroes who have graced the vaunted
roster of the mighty Avengers. You can
use the MARVEL SUPER HEROES"
game rules to relive your favorite Avengers
comic, or you can create your own new
adventures for the Avengers.
After this introduction, you'll learn about
the Avengers Mansion, and you'll be introduced
to S.H.I.E.L.D. and Nick Fury. Following
that, on pages 6-21, are game
descriptions of the past and present members
of the New York-based Avengers.
And, just so you don't think we're onesided
or anything, we've also included descriptions
of several of the villains that the
Avengers have struggled with over the
years - real creeps like Ultron and Kang
the Conqueror - plus some other interesting
people and things. That section is
on pages 22-32.
These descriptions are designed so you
can use the information when you play a
MARVEL SUPER HEROES game adventure.
We don't go into a lot of stuff about
why a hero acts like he does, or who his favorite
singer is. That's all covered in
glorious detail in the 15 mighty MARVEL
UNIVERSE comic books. If you use those
comics together with this booklet, you'll be
all set to a play a hero right down to his fingernailsl

We've got 54 different heroes, villains,
and other characters in this book, but
each description has a few things in common.
All of the information in a description
is given in this order:
HERO'S NAME; Status
Real name (if known); Title or job
Origin or classification
Ability ranks
Variable abilities
Powers and talents
Equipment/possessions
Important people
Background
Personality
A hero's name is his handle in public,
such as Captain America.
A hero's status denotes if the hero is inactive,
dead, or changed in some way. A
changed hero may have altered his name
or his powers at one point. This means the
hero doesn't really exist any more, even
though the person may still be alive.
A hero's real name is his given name; for
instance, Captain America's real name is
Steve Rogers.
A hero's title or job refers to where the
hero stands in the universe, or what he
does when he's not mopping up bad guys.
Thor, for example, is a prince; Steve Rogers
is an illustrator.
Origin or classification refers to what the
hero is and how he got his powers. Heroes
(and villains) can be hi-tech wonders, altered
humans, mutants, robots, or aliens.
If a hero or villain is immortal or is a god,
that's also listed as part of his origin. A
hero who is a god has motives and responsibilities
that are sometimes beyond human
understanding. For example, Thor,
who is the god of thunder, has a lot to do
with storms. His whole being is wrapped
up in that form of nature.
A hero who is immortal really has a good
thing going. In game terms, an immortal
hero cannot die unless a major portion of
his body's molecules are scattered. In a 
normal battle, an immortal hero's Endurance
may reach Feeble, but then the hero
mysteriously begins to recover, even if
he's had no medical attention. Hercules is
an example of a hero who is immortal.
nations in the MARVEL SUPER HEROES
Game Campaign Book. If you're not sure
how a power or talent works, look it up in
the rules. Powers and talents that don't
quite "fit" with the rules are explained as
completely as possible.
any). These are people who could affect a
hero's adventures in some way.
A brief background is given for most heroes
and villains. If Captain America
comes up against Ultron, it may help you
to know that these two have tangled more
than once before!
Definitions of a hero's ability ranks and
variable abilities are given in the MARVEL
SUPER HEROES Game Battle Book.
The powers and talents of each hero
and villain are interpreted so that they conform
as much as possible with the explaSome
heroes have special equipment or
possessions that are explained in relation
to the MARVEL SUPER HEROES game.
Notes on personality have been included
for a few heroes and villains. These
notes will help you to do a better job of
role-playing the character.

The AVENGERSTM Mansion
The Avengers Mansion, located in New
York City, is the headquarters of the
mighty Avengers. The inside booklet
cover contains maps of the mansion.
The mansion has undergone several
changes and improvements since it was
built in 1932 by Howard Stark. The Maria
Stark foundation, which funds the Avengers,
has made many contributions to the
mansion. The Starks' son Tony has supervised
several of the additions himself.
Defenses
The 12-foot-high walls that surround the
mansion are made of TANK-PRUF, a material
of Monstrous strength. Dozens of intruder
detection devices, many of them
weight-sensitive, dot the lush lawn that
rings the mansion.
The mansion doors are also boobytrapped.
Anyone who opens one without
having the proper clearance is restrained
by six 12-foot-long, steel alloy tentacles of
Amazing strength. Anyone who illegally
enters the mansion sets off the alarm system,
which rings all over tl'$ mansion.
Despite these defenses, the Avengers
maintain an open-door policy. A visitor can
easily get inside the mansion, if he uses
only the main entrance and if somebody
lets him in. Besides, the Avengers themselves
are the mansion's best defense.
Most of the other stuff is there to stop the
overly curious.
Mansion Grounds
Aside from the booby-traps, these are
pretty much your standard mansion
grounds. The garage at the rear of the
mansion, however, isn't really a garage.
It's actually a hydraulic elevator that can
lift up to 150 tons at once. The elevator
goes to the basement and sub-basement
levels, and can only be operated from inside
the mansion.
Ground Floor
This floor of the mansion looks pretty normal,
too. It includes a library, gallery, conference
room, dining hall, and kitchen.
Jarvis, the Avengers' butler, has his quarters
on this floor. The Avengers hold informal
meetings on this floor.
The ceiling, floor, and walls here are
made of reinforced concrete, a material of
Remarkable strength. The strength of the
doors and windows is Excellent.
Two elevators open onto this floor. The
"N' elevator leads to all floors in the mansion,
while the "B" elevator leads only to
those levels beneath the ground floor.
Each of these elevators can lift up to 1 0
tons.
Second Floor
Bedrooms and guest rooms take up most
of this floor; the den and the study are here
as well. The walls and floor are made of
the same Remarkable strength reinforced
concrete that's used on the ground floor.
The ceiling, however, is made from material
of Incredible strength. The bullet-proof
windows are made from Excellent
strength material; all of them are hooked
up to the alarm system.
Third Floor
This floor is a landing deck for the Avengers'
quinjets, three of which can be stored
here. Fuel and repair equipment for the
quinjets is also kept here. A radar room,
which features a communication/navigation
satellite monitor, lies in the southwest
corner of the floor.
The ceiling, floor, and walls here are all
made of Incredible strength material. The
third-floor windows that you see from the
outside of the mansion are painted images;
there are no windows on this floor.

All work and no play makes Avengers dull
heroes - so, half of this floor is for fun and
games, and half for official business.
The north side of the basement includes
a gymnasium, running track, sauna, whirlpool,
swimming pool, sun deck, and game
room. The south side includes a combat
simulation room, operating theater, and
pathology laboratory.
The main computer system in the subbasement
controls the combat simulation
room, which is capable of producing obstacles
and weapons of up to Remarkable
strengths, weights, and damages. Any
damage caused by a fired weapon in this
room is only temporary. A hero who takes
such damage here recovers Health points
every hour instead of every day. However,
if a hero takes damage from a thrown item
or from physical blows while in the combat
simulation room, treat the damage and recovery
as normal.
The operating theater has a host of
medical equipment that can help save
lives and speed up recovery. One of the
machines is the revitalizer. A dying hero
who's hooked up to the revitalizer recovers
one Endurance rank per day instead of
one per week. While a hero is under the revitalizer,
he can make Endurance FEAT
rolls at four ranks higher than normal (up
to a maximum of Shift X, not Class 1000).
If someone is already dead, however, the
revitalizer won't help.
To properly operate any of this equipment,
a hero must have a Reason rank of
Good or better. He also must make a Reason
FEAT roll. Anyone who has medical
skill, however (such as Henry Pym or
Donald Blake), can use the equipment automatically.

The ceiling, floor, and walls of the basement
are made of Incredible strength material.
The outer walls are made of a
Monstrous strength material, and are connected
to the alarm system. The rest of the
basement is not connected to that system,
however.
Sub-basement
This floor is the true heart of the mansion.
All of the equipment for running the mansion
is located here.
A miniature nuclear reactor power generator
housed on this level provides power
for the mansion. A back-up power supply
of several high-density batteries, as well
as a conventional electrical generator, are
also kept here.
Most of this level is taken up by the
Avengers' computer, which is one of the
world's fastest. This level also features an
electronics laboratory, specially designed
for robotics testing.
The ceiling, floor, and inner walls are
made of an Incredible strength material.
The outer walls are made of a special,
Monstrous strength material.
An ultra-secure assembly room stands
near the center of this level. This room is
made of Unearthly strength material. It
has a separate air supply that can last up
to one day, if the room is cut off from the
outside for any reason. Various electrical
leads and conduits, which provide access
to the main computer and other systems,
lead into this room.
Submarine Pen Level
This is the lowest level of the Avengers
Mansion. The submarine kept here is a
standard model; it has no special equipment
on board, although some could easily
be added.
Also on this level is an entrance to the
old Stark Arsenal Testing rooms. Since Arsenal
and its computer master have been
destroyed, these testing rooms are closed
off.
The ceiling, floor, and walls here are
made of the same materials as in the subbasement.

One of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s responsibilities is
to protect high-level offiCials and research
laboratories and other institutions from super-powered
villains. The organization frequently
calls on the Avengers to help on
particularly tough cases. Some of the real
toughies have involved battles against
A.LM. and HY DRA, two subversive
groups of normal humans who want to
control the world. Both of these groups
use sophisticated technology; they also
occasionally employ super-powered
agents.
S.H.I.E.L.D. has access to highly sophisticated
technology. Stane International
supplies the organization with most
of its eqUipment. Much of the S.H.I.E.L.D.
equipment listed here is available to the
Avengers in special situations. As you play
adventures using the MARVEL SUPER
HEROES game, try to keep in mind that
these two organizations will work closely
with each other in many instances.

SHRiNKING. Ant-Man's helmet contains a gas
that, when breathed, gives him Incredible
shrinking powers. Ant-Man can use this gas to
shrink to 1/2 inch tall.
iNSECT COMMUNICATION/CONTROL. AntMan
can communicate with and control insects
(usually ants) with Remarkable skill (see the
Campaign Book, p. 30, for insects' abilities). He
uses the ants to help fight crime. Sometimes, he
commands the ants to write messages by arranging
their bodies into special formations. He
can also have ants swarm over an opponent, or
order them to move items around.
Important People: The Beast is still close to the
old X-Men, and he is on good terms with the
Avengers even though he's no longer a member
of that group. He's quite fond of Wonder Man.
The Beast has recently formed the new Defenders,
and he's very territorial about them.
The Beast has had plenty of girlfriends, although
he doesn't tend to get himself into longterm
relationships. Most of the Beast's relatives
are still alive.
Background: The Beast was born with great
agility. Professor X offered to train the Beast to
use his power for good purposes. As a member
ofthe X-Men, he learned a lot about combat and
teamwork.
The Beast later got a job at the Brand Corporation.
There he discovered a serum that could
change his appearance. He figured he could
change his looks to ferret out enemy agents, but
instead the serum enhanced his beastlike
powers - and made him look like a beast, too!
The change is irreversible. Hank McCoy has
learned to accept his new appearance, and
sometimes he even seems to revel in it.
FLYING ANT. Ant-Man usually calls a flying ant
to be his steed. Because the flying ant is so
small, its speed is Poor.
VOICE AMPLIFIER. Ant-Man's helmet contains
a voice amplifier so that he can be heard at normal
pitch and volume even when he is only 1/2
inch tall.
Talents: Henry Pym is a biochemist of Remarkable
skill. In the past, Ant-Man would occasionally
cook up something in his laboratory to help
solve a caper.
Important People: Janet Van Dyne and Henry
Pym tied the knot in later years. Ant-Man's only
known friends have been the Avengers.
Background: Henry Pym discovered the "Pym
particle:' which allowed anyone who breathed it
to control his size. Pym and his wife Janet (who
is the Wasp) would use the particle to become
super-small crimefighters.
Henry Pym has had more identities than any
other Avenger. Besides having been Ant-Man,
he has been known as Giant-Man, Goliath, and
Yellowjacket. Since his abilities have changed
over time, the various heroes that Pym has been
all possess different ability ranks.
Henry Pym is no longer Ant-Man. Pym
passed his Ant-Man identity and his helmet on
to electronics expert and former cat burglar
Scott Lang. The current Ant-Man is not a member
of the Avengers.

been keeping these feelings under control as
the gung-ho leader of the Avengers' West Coast

surge raises his Fighting and Strength by one or
two ranks (Judge's choice, but only a one-rank
increase per round). If he is severely provoked,
the Hulk's Strength can actually reach Class
1 000-but the Judge should notietthis happen
very often; Unearthly or Shift X Strength is usually
more than enough to deal with any problem.

Rhodes, one of Stark's hired pilots, wore the armor
for a time while Stark was battling against
alcoholism. Now that Stark has solved his problems,
he has taken up the armor again.
Important People: Her brain patterns were
stolen from the Wasp. Joeasta had an affinity toward
the Vision because he was also a robot in
search of his identity. She felt alienated by the
Avengers and did not become close friends with
any of them.
Background: Jocasta was created by Ultron to
be his bride. Ultron gave her the Wasp's brain
patterns, but Joeasta quickly developed her
own personality. Although she loved Ultron, she
realized that he was totally evil and helped the
Avengers to defeat him. She became a guest of
the Avengers, but never received status as a full
member, and the others constantly seemed to
forget that she was there. With the help of Machine
Man, she defeated Ultron once morebut

of the power before a stun result is applied.
Background: Moondragon is not a loving person.
She holds herself more important than
most anything or anyone else. She was raised
from childhood by the Eternals of Titan and was
trained by the Shao-Lom priests in many physical
and mental disciplines. She joined the
Avengers to fight against Thanos, the mad ruler
of the Titan Eternals, but then left the group to
try to force peace on the population of an inhabited
planet by using her powers to take away the
free will of those she encountered. Her father,
Drax the Destroyer, joined forces with the
Avengers to defeat Moondragon and her plans
- but Drax died in the effort. As punishment for
her crimes, Thor took Moondragon to Asgard to
be judged by Odin, who put a restraining headband
upon her and sent her to Earth to learn humility.
She is currently a reluctant member of the
Defenders.
roll or be stunned for 1 -10 rounds. An opponent's
body armor is only half as effective as
normal against this form of attack by Mantis.
Important People: A former Vietnamese citizen,
Mantis knows people from her homeland.
Her mother is dead; her father is Libra, a villain.
During her tenure as an Avenger she was attached
to the Swordsman. See also "Background"
below for more personal information.
Background: After her parents were killed in Indochina,
Mantis was raised by the priests of
Pama. The priests were actually pacifistic Kree.
Knowing that she would someday be the Celestial
Madonna, the priests raised her and taught
her all they knew. She became especially adept
at the Kree martial arts. She learried to communicate
telepathically with the Cotati, tree-like aliens
that lived with the priests. From this
experience she gained the power of empathy.
Later she met the Swordsman, who took her out
of Indochina, and together they joined the
Avengers. In a battle against Kang, the Swordsman
saved Mantis's life at the expense of his
own. The eldest Cotati on Earth reanimated the
Swordsman's body with his own life force and
married Mantis. They then left Earth to become
the parents of the Celestial Messiah.

THICK SKIN. Ms. Marvel's body was tough
enough to provide her with Incredible protection
from damage.
SEVENTH SENSE. By making an Intuition
FEAT roll, she could get a general impression of
danger in the near future. She was able to sense
such things as an imminent ambush, the
powers of an unknown assailant, or what's
around the corner up ahead.
Important People: She respects and likes most
of the Avengers. Carol Danvers was at one time
a companion to the X-Men, but without super
powers.
Background: A Kree device, the psychemagnitron,
altered Carol Danvers' genetic
make-up. She derived most of her powers from
the changes this device caused. When she first
gained her powers, she would change from
Carol Danvers to Ms. Marvel without knowing it.
Later, she just remained Ms. Marvel and only removed
her costume when she wanted to become
Carol Danvers. Then she lost all of her
powers and memories, thanks to the power-absorbing
mutant Rogue. More recently she has
become Binary, a heroine with very different

normal human's, enabling him to withstand the
strains of high velocity. Quicksilver has Typical
protection from damage.
AIR CONTROL. By running in circles, Quicksilver

area. This is an attack against many opponents
(see p. 12 of the Battle Book), using his Fighting
ability. The attack does no damage but can stun

probability fields, she must make a successful
Psyche FEAT roll. Each use of the power after
the first on the same day requires a shift one
column to the left. Anything she causes to happen
must be related to altering the probability of
something that . is possible, however unlikely.
For instance, she cannot create a table out of
thin air. However, she could make a chair suddenly
collapse for no apparent reason. Her
power is so unusual that it frequently catches
victims and onlookers by surprise. Wanda is
much less comfortable when using her power to

the Hulk. She is friendly with most of the
Avengers, especially the Wasp. She hates male
chauvinists.
Background: Jennifer Walters was shot by a
gangster while her cousin Bruce Banner was
visiting her. To save her life, Bruce Banner gave
her a blood transfusion, and she gained some of
the Hulk's abilities in that way. When she was
later attacked by the same gangsters, she became
excited and angry, which caused her to
tum into the She-Hulk. She found that she liked
being the She-Hulk better than being Jennifer
Walters. She accepted an offer to be an
Avenger, but then recently became a reserve
Avenger when she replaced the Thing in the
Fantastic Four.
this doesn't reduce her skill at using the power.
Natural materials include such things as fire,
water, earth, air, wood, organic items, and some
metals. "Unnatural" materials are plastic,
strange alloys, artificial energies, and so forth.
Her power has a range of 2 areas.
Talents: Although her powers do not stem from
the occult or witchcraft, she has studied these
subjects and has Excellent knowledge of them.
Important People: Her father is Magneto, a

toward mutants throughout the world. Her
brother Quicksilver is living with the Inhumans
and has married into their royal family. Her
adopted father is the late Django Maximoff. She
is married to the Vision, an android. The Scarlet
Witch has few friends, all of them Avengers and
Inhumans.
Background: The Scarlet Witch was born with

FLIGHT. Startox can fly at Monstrous speeds
through mental control. All Eternals can fly, but
his top speed is faster than most others of his
race can attain.
DENSE FLESH. Titan Eternals' bodies are
slightly tougher than normal humans'. Startox
has Good protection from damage because of
this.
PSIONIC TICKLE. He can mentally stimulate
the pleasure centers of the brain of any humanoid
in the same area he is in. He must make a
green Psyche FEAT roll to affect any target with
a Psyche lower than his own, a yellow FEAT roll
against any target with a Psyche equal to his
own, and a red FEAT roll against anyone with a
Psyche one rank higher than his own. Anyone
with a Psyche two ranks or more higher than
Startox's (in other words, Incredible or better) is
immune to this power.
Any victim of this power can try to make a yellow
Psyche FEAT roll each round to recover
from the effects. Anyone who has fallen prey to
Startox's power may be agreeable to Startox's
suggestions. Some aliens are immune to this
power, and beings filled with hate, like the Hulk,
may be granted column shifts to increase their
probability of resisting or throwing off the effects
of this power.
Note on Resources: Although Startox has
nothing of value on Earth, he is related to the
rulers of Titan. As such, he can get access to
Monstrous resources if the occasion merits it.
Important People: Being a Titan Eternal, Starfox
remains close to his people, particularly his
family. His only friends on earth are the Avengers.
He likes to be with women and seems to be
fond of the She-Hulk.
Background: Eros grew up to be a fun-loving,
pleasure-seeking man. His brother Thanos took
over the government of Titan by force, and during
the next few years Eros fought against him.
He eventually worked with the Avengers to bring
about his brother's downfall. Then, out of boredom,
he traveled to Earth looking for some excitement.
He applied to be an Avenger, and the
group accepted him.

master of bladed weapons. He shifts one
column to the right when using any handheld
bladed weapon in combat.
The Swordsman was also well versed in the
martial arts.
Equipment/Possessions:
SWORD. He had a special sword, a Unique
Weapon which utilized Makluan technology,
made from a material of Monstrous strength. By
pressing a button in the sword's hilt, he could
produce a variety of effects: energy beam, disintegrator,
flame, lightning, gas. All of the attack
forms do Remarkable damage except for the
gas. Any character who breathes the gas must
make a yellow Endurance FEAT roll or fall unconscious
for an hour. The range of the sword's
distance weapons is 4 areas; the gas can only
be sprayed in the same area the Swordsman occupies.

Important People: The Swordsman worked

undercover for the Mandarin inside the Avengers
group, he fell in love with the Scarlet Witch,
and later he fell in love with Mantis, a member of

as a criminal. He was active in a plot by the
Mandarin to destroy the Avengers, and fought
the Avengers several times after that. Later he
changed his ways and joined the group as a
hero. His love for Mantis caused him to give his
life for hers when he threw himself between her
and Kang just as that villain released a powertul

DENSE FLESH. Thor's body is as tough as
brick, which gives him Excellent protection as
body armor. The standard for most Asgardians
is Good protection.
MJOLNIR. Thor's magical hammer, Mjolnir, is a
Unique Weapon made from mystical Uru metal,
a Class 1 000 material. Thor's fighting is only
Shift X, not Class 1 000, with it. The hammer has
the following enchantments:
1) Return. The hammer always returns to the
thrower's hand and is caught automatically in
the same round it was thrown. Thor can throw it
up to 10 areas.
2) Worthiness. Only those who are worthy
(good, honorable, etc.) may lift Mjolnir. If Thor
himself becomes villainous or cowardly, he cannot
lift the hammer again until he proves himself
worthy. Even a worthy character must have at
least 1000 Karma and Remarkable Strength. A
non-living force may lift the hammer if it has at
least Remarkable Strength.
3) Weather Control. The wielder has Unearthly
control of weather. He can call or dispel
storms. He can cause villains to be struck by
lightning bolts for Monstrous damage. He can
18
make lightning bolts come directly from the
hammer.
4) Dimensional Travel. By spinning the hammer
just right, the owner can cross into other dimensions
such as Asgard, Olympus, Limbo,
and numerous pocket dimensions.
FLIGHT. This power is accomplished by using
the hammer. By throwing it and grabbing onto
the thong, Thor is pulled along behind the hammer.
Thor can mentally control his flight path.
The only limit to how much weight the hammer
can lift is Thor's Strength. He flies with Amazing
speed.
SHIELD. By spinning his hammer swiftly, Thor
can deflect missiles and energy beams of Remarkable
strength or less.
ALTER EGO. Until recently Thor could assume
the identity of Dr. Donald Blake by striking the
hammer on the ground. When Thor was in the
form of Dr. Blake, the hammer was a walking
stick that had none of the hammer's powers but
could not be destroyed. Striking the stick on the
ground turned Dr. Blake back into Thor. If the
hammer was ever out of Thor's grasp for more
than 60 seconds, he reverted to his alter ego automatically.
Odin recently lifted this enchantment
on Thor.
Talents: Thor trained for many years with a
sword in Asgard. He gets a column shift to the
right when using one.
Note on Resources: While Thor's personal resources
are Excellent and usually sufficient for
his needs, in times of dire emergency he can approach
his father Odin, whose resources are
Class 1000.
Important People: All the inhabitants of
Asgard, in particular Odin (lord of the Norse
gods of Asgard), Loki (his evil stepbrother), and
Sif (his betrothed), are important to Thor. He has
no real friends on earth other than t?e members
of the Avengers and a few other heloes.
Background: Thor is the son of Odin. For many
centuries Thor adventured in Asgard, fighting
storm giants, trolls and other adversaries. In order
to teach Thor humility, Odin enchanted him
into the mortal form of Dr. Donald Blake. After
learning humility he remained on Midgard
(Earth) as one of its champions. He is called
upon to settle affairs in Asgard occasionally.

high or low denSity, he can barely move
or fight.
PHASING. He can pass through most materials,
even some Class 1 000 objects like Captain
America's shield. The Vision cannot make any
other object immaterial. Some materials and
some types of force fields will either prevent his
passing through them or else harm him when he
tries to do so.
FLIGHT. This is another use of his phasing
power. By making himself very light, the Vision
can float through the air. His power rank is Typical.
He can't carry anything while flying,

Powers:
EXTRAORDINARY SENSES. Tigra has Monstrous
vision, hearing and smell. Her smell is
good enough to allow her to track a person
through a crowd.
INFRA VISION. She can see in the dark. The pupils
of her eyes are shaped as vertical Slits, like a
cat's.
EMPATHY. This power works just like telepathy,
except that only emotions are received and
nothing can be sent.
RUNNING SPEED. Tigra can run at the rate of 4
areas a round for up to 3 rounds before tiring
and slowing to normal speed.
SOLAR BEAMS. The Vision can shoot beams
of solar energy from the jewel in his forehead.
They act like laser beams, doing Remarkable
damage to whatever they hit.
DENSITY ATTACK. This is a normal attack using
his Fighting rank for its FEAT roll. By sticking
a part of his immaterial body into an opponent
and then resolidifying it, he can cause up to Remarkable
damage. In addition, his victim must
make a yellow Endurance FEAT roll or fall unconscious
from the pain. If the FEAT roll fails altogether
(white result), the victim loses all of his
Health pOints, falls unconscious, and is dying.
This is such a dangerous attack that the Vision
does not use it except in emergencies,
such as to prevent murder. The Vision must pay
25 Karma points every time the power is used
(and the Judge may invoke an additional Karma
penalty if the power is used casually or unnecessarily).
The Vision's density attack is not affected
by body armor.
POWER SOURCE. The Vision draws power
from light, which is filtered through the jewel in
his forehead. If he exerts himself for a long period
of time or is kept in total darkness for 24
hours, the Vision falls "unconscious" from lack
of energy.
18lents: The Vision has a natural understanding
of biology and engineering.
Important People: The Vision is married to
Wanda Maximoff, the Scarlet Witch. His only
friends are the Avengers. He hates Ultron, his
creator.
Important People: Tigra was only a member of
the Avengers for a short time and did not become
good friends with any of them. She is a de
facto member of the Cat People, an alien race.
She has a grudge against HYDRA, a group that
tried to use her powers for evil purposes.
Background: As a laboratory assistant, Greer
Nelson agreed to take treatments to enhance
her physical and mental abilities as part of an
experiment. The head of the laboratory was actually
one of the Cat People, an alien race
evolved from cats. In her pursuit of HYDRA
agents who were trying to obtain a black plague
serum from the lab, she was mortally wounded.
To save her life, the Cat People mystically transformed
her into one of them. However, she still
had the extraordinary abilities gained from the
experiments as well. She took the name of Tigra
and thereafter pursued a crimefighting career.
For a short time she was a member of the
Avengers. She is now a West-coast Avenger.

Important People: His brother is Eric Williams,
also known as the Grim Reaper, a notorious villain.
He has several friends among the Avengers.
He is particularly fond of the Beast, a former
Avenger.
Background: The owner of a failing company,
Simon Williams fell in with Baron Zemo and the
Enchantress, members of the Masters of Evil.
He was subjected to an "ioniC ray" treatment
that gave him extraordinary strength and inVUlnerability.
Zemo told him that a side effect of the
treatment would kill him unless he took an antidote
that Zemo provided him with every week.
Then the Masters of Evil, with Wonder Man on
their side, took on the Avengers. In the battle,
Wonder Man betrayed Baron Zemo, and the
Masters of Evil were defeated. But Wonder Man
apparently died because he didn't have the antidote
he needed any more. His brother, the Grim
Reaper, took the body to a voodoo priest to have
it revived. Brought back to "life" as a mindless
zombie, Wonder Man followed the commands
of his brother and attacked the Avengers. However,
he slowly began to regain his humanity. It
was later discovered that he was not dead, but
only in a deep coma while undergoing a permanent
metamorphosis into a form that allowed
him to retain his powers.
INSECT COMMUNICATION/CONTROL. The
Wasp has Typical skill in communicating with
and controlling insects. She seldom uses this
power.
Important People: For a while Janet Van Dyne
was married to Henry Pym, also known <at various
times) as Ant-Man, Giant-Man, Goliath, and
Yellowjacket. She has no known friends other
than the Avengers and a few independent heroes.
She is very active in charity and social
work.
Background: When Henry Pym discovered the
particle that could enable people to change their
body size, she joined with him to use the power
for the cause of good. Together they have fought
crime for many years. She was the chairperson
of the Avengers for quite some time.
Personality: For a long time Janet Van Dyne
pretended to be a dumb female to fit the stereotypical
image others had of her. She has since
dropped that ruse and now acts as intelligent as
she truly is. She has expensive tastes and an
obsession for fine clothing. 
HONORABLE MENTION

served in the armed forces. This talent is treated
the same as martial arts.
He also has the ability to remain unsurprised
and not panic in almost any situation. Having
served the Avengers for many years, he has
seen it all.
Important People: Jarvis used to be the Stark
family butler and has served the Avengers for
many years. He is not actually a personal friend
of any of them, but he is a faithful servant for all
of them. Some of nis relatives are still alive. He

Powers:
SHRINKING. Yellowjacket could shrink at will.
Constant exposure to the shrinking gas he developed
has given him Incredible shrinking
powers.
PROTECTED SENSES. Yellowjacket wore a vi·
sor that protects his eyes from blinding flashes.
INSECT COMMUNICATION/CONTROL. Yellowjacket
could communicate with and control
insects with Remarkable skill; he usually does
this with bees.
FLIGHT. When he was at his smallest size, a
pair of wings unfolded from his back, enabling
him to fly with Good speed. He can only lift
about an ounce of weight in his small size.
STINGERS. Yellowjacket could fire electrical
blasts through his gloves, doing Remarkable
damage to whatever they hit. The power source
was contained in the two ridges of his costume
that cover his shoulders.
'&Ilents: Henry Pym is a biochemist of Remarkable
skill.
Important People: Janet Van Dyne (also known
as the Wasp) was his wife. They were recently
divorced. His only known friends are members
of the Avengers.
Background: Henry Pym discovered the "Pym
particle," which allowed anyone who breathed it
to control his size. He and Janet Van Dyne used
this gas to become super-small crimefighters.
Henry eventually gained the ability to grow to
tremendous size after repeated exposure to the
gas containing the particle. His career as Yellowjacket
began when he inhaled a newly invented
gas that caused him to think he was a
different person - and he believed that he had
killed Henry Pym. This episode marked the beginning
of a period of mental instability that he
suffered through.
Henry Pym has had more identities than any
other Avenger. He has been Ant-Man, GiantMan,
GOliath, and Yellowjacket. Since his abilities
have changed over time, the various heroes
that Pym has been all possess different ability
ranks.

and his \:>rutish alter ego for many years. In an
attempt to stop one of the Hulk's rampages, he
contacted a group of heroes that later became
the Avengers. Rick was made an honorary
member of the group, and he traveled with Captain
America for quite some time.
Shortly after Captain Mar-Veil came to Earth,
Rick found himself tied to that hero in a strange
way: When one of them was on Earth, the other
lay in the Negative Zone. (Captain Mar-Veil
spent far more time in the Negative Zone than
Rick did.) During the Avengers' battle with the
Skrulls, the Kree Supreme Intelligence tapped
Rick's memory of heroes from the past to wipe
out the Skrull fleet. Rick has Avengers sec:;urity
?IAAl'Aln(!A and is still a respected honorary
member of the group.

him from being surprised in most cases.
He had Incredible infravision, and all of his other
senses were also of Incredible rank.
PROTECTED SENSES. All of Arsenal's senses
have Incredible protection against sensory
overload (see pp. 39-40 of the Campaign Book).
BODY ARMOR. Arsenal's non-metallic body
gave him Amazing protection from damage.
FORCE FIELDS. Arsenal had a number of offensive
force fields. These fields did not prevent
him from being damaged, but anyone who tried
to walk through one of them took damage. He

Powers:
ABSORPTION. The Absorbing Man can take
on the properties of anything he touches. The
molecules of his body actually change into the
substance of whatever he is "absorbing:' (This
requires the Judge to work hard to keep the battle
balanced.) As a general rule, the Absorbing
Man gets the Strength, Endurance, and body
armor equivalent of whatever material he
touches. For instance, if he were to touch a steel
girder, he would have Remarkable Strength, Endurance,
and body armor. When he assumes
another form, his Health is adjusted to the sum
of his current Fighting, Agility, Strength, and Endurance
numbers.
If the absorbed material is holding or emitting
an extreme amount of energy (it is very hot, very
cold, has a lot of electricity, etc.), he absorbs the
was known to have a close-range electrified
force field that zapped small creatures and objects
that came close to him. He also had a
longer-range photoelectric force field that could
harm even phasing opponents. Both force fields
did Remarkable damage and were not affected
by body armor. If any force field is used more
than once before being recharged, its protection
is lowered by one rank for each use after the
first.
SHOULDER GUNS. Twin radiation blast cannons
push up through Arsenal's shoulders.
They are treated as one weapon, range 7 areas,
that does Incredible damage.
CHEST CANNON. A large force cannon in his
chest can pop out and fire, doing Unearthly
damage to any target it hits in the same area as
Arsenal. When firing the cannon, Arsenal shifts
one column to the left on Agility.
GAS. Using gas jets located in his helmet, Arsenal
can fill the area he is in with a dense gas that
blocks normal vision. Anyone who breathes the
gas must make a yellow Endurance FEAr roll or
fall unconscious.
FREEZING UNITS. Arsenal's body contains
freezing units that can coat anything he is holding
with Incredibly strong ice in one round.
AIR GUN. These weapons pop out of Arsenal's
palms. They can shoot Remarkably strong
blasts of air which will disrupt some missiles and
can knock down heroes up to one area away.
The force can be reversed to create a Remarkably
powerful suction.
properties of the energy as well. He has at times
turned himself into pure energy by absorbing
such things as lightning bolts. The Judge will
have to decide what useful properties the energy
source might have, and at what ranks.
He can absorb the physical shape or characteristics
of an object. If he touches a mace, he
gets its spikes as well as the strength of iron. If
he touches a building, he can grow to the height
of the structure.
The Absorbing Man can take on another character's
physical powers by touching that character.
However, he often lacks full control over
powers he gains in this way. For instance, he
can gain the powers of the Vision, but may not
be able to control his density changes.
WEAPON. The prison ball and chain he carries
always undergoes the same transformation as
he does, so long as he is touching it at the time
of the change. It is a magical weapon, and he is
very skillful with it. He gains a one-column shift
to the tight when using it in combat.
Important People: While he has taken occasional
companions, the Absorbing Man has
never formed a close friendship with anyone.
The Avengers have defeated him so many times
that he often seeks them out for revenge.
Background: When Crusher Creel was in
prison, Loki gave him the power of absorption,
hoping that he would defeat Thor with it. As the
Absorbing Man, Creel easily escaped from
prison, but hasn't had it easy since then. He has
fought heroes many times, usually going down
to defeat because he is not very bright.
BLINDING FLASH. His helmet can produce a
blinding light like a giant flash bUlb. Anyone who
sees it go off is blinded for 1-10 rounds, but a
victim is allowed an Endurance FEAT roll to
avoid the effect. Blinded characters suffer a
three-column shift to the left when fighting.
COMPUTER LINK. Arsenal was linked to a
computer that could enhance its senses by one
rank and its Intuition by three ranks. The computer
was responsible for Arsenal's programming
directives, and the robot always obeyed
the computer.

Powers:
DENSE FLESH. Attuma's flesh is the equivalent
of Good body armor. In addition to the other advantages
this gives him, it enables him to withstand
the great pressures of the ocean depths
where he lives.
EXTRAORDINARY VISION. His vision is particularly
acute in the green and blue portion of the
spectrum. He has Remarkable vision underwater.
This is also a beneficial adaptation for underwater
existence.
SWIMMING SPEED. Attuma can swim underwater
at Remarkable speed.
SPACE SHIP. The Collector's craft has Class
1 000 speed. It is capable of bridging dimensions
and traveling from one end of the universe
to the other.
Important People: He had a wife and a daughter
at one time, but his daughter left home many
millennia ago and his wife died soon thereafter.
(His daughter is now also deceased.) The Collector
occasionally associates with the other EIders
of the Universe. He values his collections
above all else.
Background: When his wife died he meditated
for more than 50 years to find a meaning for his
life. He foresaw the possible destruction of the
universe at the hands of very powerful beings.
So that he could repopulate the universe if this
did happen, he set out to collect living beings
and artifacts from all the worlds of the known
universe. He has converted many extra-dimensional
worlds into museums to store all of his acquisitions.
In recent centuries his collecting has
become an obsession, and he has lost track of
his original reason for doing so. Now he collects
solely for the sake of collecting.
WATER BREATHER. If he is out of the water for
more than 10 minutes (about 40 rounds), he begins
to suffocate. Out of the water, his Strength
is only Incredible, and his Health is adjusted accordingly
down to 1 30.
WEAPON. Attuma usually fights with a sword or
war-hammer in his hand. The weapon is usually
made from material of Amazing strength.
Important People: Attuma has no known living
relatives and no friends. He rules the Atlantean
barbarians by brute force.
Background: Attuma grew up to become the
ruler of the barbarian tribes of the Atlanteans.
He believes that he will conquer Atlantis by
force because of a prophesy he discovered as a
young adult. He has fought Prince Namor, the
Sub-Mariner, many times but has always been
defeated in the end. He has also fought the
Avengers.

Powers:
STONE TOUCH. Anything touched by the palm
of the Grey Gargoyle's right hand is turned to
stone for one hour. The touch affects and also
penetrates thin materials like cloth or costumes
to affect the body beneath, but it does not penetrate
thicker and stronger materials, such as
Iron Man's armor.
He can affect a volume of up to 10 cubic feet
at one time, but the only object affected is the
one he actually touches. For instance, if he were
to touch a table, the table would turn to stone,
but not the things on it. Likewise, if he touched
one object on the table, it would turn to stone but
the table would be unaffected. The Grey Gargoyle
must make a Fighting FEAT roll to touch a
moving object. A stationary object is touched
automatically if he is close enough to touch it
and wishes to do so.

Powers:
GRAVITY CONTROL. Graviton has Unearthly
control of gravity, able to reverse or intensify the
force at will. He can use this power to fly or to
simulate telekinesis, and is able to move a mass
of up to 1 ,000 tons. His flying speed is limited to
Excellent because he can't breathe if he goes
any faster. Graviton can project force beams of
gravity, causing Unearthly damage. He can create
Unearthly strong force fields that can extend
almost five miles in diameter or be skin-tight.
Graviton's control of gravity comes very easily
to him. It does not seriously fatigue him, and
he can maintain or perform up to four different
actions in one round. If he attempts more than
Any attacks against a stone object are treated
as if the object has Incredible body armor. Living
things turned to stone will take damage as stone
does; objects still use the rules for breaking
things (p. 8 of the Battle BOOk).
TRANSFORMATION. By touching himself with
his right palm, the Grey Gargoyle can turn himself
into living stone. In this state he has Incredible
protection from damage, plus the physical
abilities given above. (As a normal human, his
physical abilities are only Typical, and his
Health is 24.) In his living-stone form, he frequently
climbs walls made of less than Incredible
material by punching hand holds in it with his
stone-hard fingers.
LEAPING. His granite-like Strength enables the
Grey Gargoyle to leap up to 2 areas away, even
in his stone form.
Important People: He has no known living rela·
tives. He has very few friends and usually works
alone. He has a grudge against the Avengers
and particularly against Thor.
Background: When he was a young chemist,
Paul Duval spilled a strange chemical on his
right hand. He soon discovered that he had the
power to turn things to stone, and shortly thereafter
he turned to crime to get rich. But stealing
was too easy, so he started a battle with Thor for
his hammer because he believed that the
weapon granted Thor his immortality. He has
fought the Avengers in the past.
four actions at once, he must make an Endurance
FEAT roll to maintain all of them. Failure indicates
that only the two actions most recently
attempted will remain in effect.
Important People: He is in love with a girl
named Judy, last name and current whereabouts
unknown. He has no living relatives or
friends.
Background: As a phYSiCist, Franklin Hall was
experimenting with teleportation. An accidental
energy discharge gave him the power to control
gravity. His ambitious nature got the better of
him, and he singlehandedly took on and defeated
the Avengers, including Thor and Iron
Man. During the battle, Judy apparently committed
suicide. In his grief and fury, Graviton
called upon too much power and caused his
body to merge with a large mass. He eventually
was able to separate his molecules from those
of the large mass. Judy survived, saved by Jarvis
at the last moment. Graviton has since become
a regular foe of the Avengers, possessing
enough power to take them all on.

armor has a complete life-support system; he
does not need to breathe outside air or eat while
he wears it.
GAUNTLETS. The gauntlets of his armor contain
anti-gravity projectors that can lift objects

Powers:
SCYTHE. The Grim Reaper's weapon is a steel
scythe (Incredible material) that he holds in his
right hand. All of his powers come from it. In
combat it is a Hack & Slash weapon because of
its sharp edge. At his option, the Grim Reaper
can use it as a blunt weapon, taking a onecolumn
shift to the right when doing so.
POWER BLASTER. The handle of the scythe
can shoot beams of energy that do Remarkable
damage up to 5 areas away.
GLIDING. The blade on the scythe can be made
to spin like a helicopter rotor. This allows the
Grim Reaper to fall from a great height and not
take damage, but it only provides him Poor gliding
control. He cannot attack with the scythe
when he is gliding.
TIME SHIP. This device weighs 11 tons. It is
made out of a metal that is an Incredible material.
If it takes 50 points of damage it becomes
unusable. This machine can send people and itself
to anywhere in time. It can also pluck people
out of time and bring them to the Ship.
DEVICES. Kang has the resources of an entire
planet in the 31st century at his beck and call.
He has been known to use a wide variety of devices,
none of which was ever seen in his possession
before it was used. Given time, he can
build any device of up to Amazing power.
Important People: Kang has many incarnations
in time; see the "Background" section. He
is in love with a woman named Ravonna, who
lies in a deep coma. He is constantly trying to
find a way to revive her.
Background: Born in the 31st century, Kang
found a time machine left behind by Doctor
Doom. He began his conquests by taking over
Egypt in the year 2950 B.C., calling that incarnation
of himself Rama-Tut. As the Scarlet Centurion,
he tangled with the Avengers and
conquered Earth in the late 20th century, although
it was the Earth of an alternate time
branch. After that he took over an alternate
Earth in A.D. 4000. Using his advanced technology,
he then conquered his native 31st century
Earth. From that time onward, many manifestations
of Kang occur in the time stream. One of
them became the benevolent Immortus, master
of Limbo.
BUZZSAW. The spinning scythe can also be
used as a buzzsaw, able to do Excellent damage
as a Hack & Slash weapon.
BODY ARMOR. The scythe can spin fast
enough to act as Remarkable body armor
against solid projectiles. Any opponent must
make a red Agility FEAT roll to safely attack the
Grim Reaper when the scythe is spinning. Otherwise
the attacker takes damage as if he had
been hit by it.
PARALYZING TOUCH. The touch of the handle
of the scythe can cause a deep coma or release
a victim from such a coma. The paralyzing
touch cannot be attempted in combat unless the
victim has been knocked down or stunned. The
victim can avoid the coma by making a red Endurance
FEAT roll.
KNOCK-OUT GAS. The handle can spray one
dose of knock-out gas that fills one area and remains
in effect for five rounds. Anyone in that
area must make a yellow Endurance FEAT roll
each round he remains in the area or pass out
for half an hour. The Grim Reaper carries two replacement
capsules, one dose apiece. However,
it takes at least a round to put one in.
Important People: Eric Williams' brother is Simon
Williams, also known as Wonder Man. The
Grim Reaper has disowned his brother and
hates him. He blames the Avengers for what
happened to his brother.

he needs is some type of matter
around him, a medium through which sound
can travel. In a vacuum he would dissipate.
BODY ARMOR. Because his body is not made

everyone within 10 areas of him. Each victim
has the chance to make a red Endurance FEAT

deaf. All victims regain their hearing after
one day.
VIBRANIUM. If more than a pound of vibranium
is brought into the same area as Klaw, his body
becomes unstable, collapses, and is absorbed
into his sound converter. Klaw's body armor is
no good against an attack made with an object
that has vibranium in it, such as Captain America's
shield.
Background: Ulysses Klaw was a physicist
who worked on methods of turning sound into "
matter. He found that he needed a large quantity
of vibranium for his experiments. He armed himself
with a sonic blaster and attempted to obtain
it illegally, but was thwarted by the boy who later

The Kree is an alien race that keeps tabs on the
earth frequently. Most of the powerful individuals
are blue-skinned humanoids, but the majority
of the race's members have the same skin
color as humans.
They are extremely militaristic and want to
conquer as much territory as possible. They
have been at war with the Skrulls, a shape-shifting
alien race, for longer than all of recorded human
history. Their advanced technology makes
them a threat to any race.
They control more than 1 ,000 star systems.
They have mastered intergalactic and hyperspace
travel and they possess an abundance of
powerful weaponry.
There have been three major representatives
of the Kree to Earth: Captain Mar-Veil, Ronan
the Accuser, and Supremor (The Supreme Intelligence).
All are detailed in this section. For the

Popularity: 7
Powers:
COMPUTER BRAIN. The Mad Thinker's mind
is adept at organizing information, but he is almost
incapable of original ideas. Most of his
plots and inventions are combinations or new
applications of other people's ideas. He is able
to calculate the probability of any event happening.
The only thing preventing him from having a
perfect knowledge of what will happen is the xfactor
- variables that are unknown to him or
that cannot be calculated. Most heroes have an
x-factor in their actions and behavior, which is
why he has trouble succeeding against them.
Any scheme he plots is completely thought out
in advance; however, the x-factor frequently
messes up his plans.

Powers:
DENSE FLESH. Loki's flesh is the equivalent of
Excellent body armor. (Normal Asgardians have
Good body armor.) Loki also has the power to reattach
a part of his body that was severed, even
his head.
MAGICIAN. Loki is a Monstrous master of sorcery.
He usually casts spells that change him
into various animals, animate objects, or hypnotize
people. One of his favorite schemes is to enhance
the power of a villain and send the villain
forth to battle Loki's enemies. He is extremely
adept at using personal and universal energies.
He rarely uses dimensional energies.
MAGICAL TALISMANS. Loki has access to
several magical talismans that can greatly increase
his power, most of the time by making
WEAPONS. He has a large number of weapons
and androids at his beck and call. None of these
are new or unique; they are all ideas taken from
somewhere or someone else. He is very good at
combining old ideas to make his robots and devices.
His androids can have powers and abilities
of up to Incredible rank, but their Reason,
Intuition, and Psyche rarely exceed Typical.

250 miles away, even while in prison.
Important People: He has worked with the
Puppet Master on occasion. He usually prefers
to work alone. It is not known if he has any living
family, and it is unlikely that he has any friends.
BaCkground: Most of the Mad Thinker's history
is shrouded in mystery. He began his criminal
career by trying to take control of the various
criminal gangs !n New York. He soon stopped
using normal accomplices, since he considers
himself resourceful enough to operate without
them.
the effects of his spells permanent. He can obtain
a magical talisman, for any purpose, of up
to Amazing power.
Important People: His wife is Sigyn. His father
is Odin by adoption, and therefore Thor is his
foster brother. Loki's true father was king of the
giants that live in a land near Asgard. He has
worked with Karnilla, Hela, and other Asgardian
deities. He cares nothing about humans or any
creature less powerful than himself.
Background: Loki's history is a long one. He is
several thousand years old. He started out baing
known as the god of mischief, but as his
pranks grew more deadly he became known as
the god of evil. He is responsible for the creation
or assistance of several of Earth's most powerful
villains, such as the Absorbing Man. He has
plotted the death of his hated half-brother Thor
innumerable times. He has thwarted the will of
Odin frequently, but Odin will not kill him because
he is the AII-Father's adopted son. Loki
has spent most of his time under house arrest in
Asgard.

Poweni:
MIND CONTROL. The Ringmaster normally
has Good mind control powers. His hat improves
that power to Incredible by amplifying
his mental commands. The victim(s) must be
looking at the Ringmaster to be affected.
(Hence, Daredevil and other sightless characters
are immune to the Ringmaster's power, as
is someone like Spider-Man who can fight with
his eyes clo$ed. Because the control is visually
transmitted, the Ringmaster can affect large
groups of people if he can get all of them to look
at him.
CIRCUS OF CRIME. The Ringmaster owns and
operates an organization called the ?ircus of
Crime. A variety of circus performers have
If it is imitating only one person, the SuperAdaptoid
becomes an exact duplicate, including
clothing and personal items. If it is
combining several people, it imitates bits and
pieces from each person's appearance. How- .
ever, the android's "skin" takes on a greenish
color when it duplicates more than one being at
once.
Each of the abilities it duplicates is equal to
the highest rank in that ability possessed by any
of the beings it is duplicating. It makes functional
duplicates of any pertinent objects, such
as Captain America's shield, Hawkeye's bow, or
Iron Man's armor. It can copy anything up to and
including Monstrous materials.
Background: The Super-Adaptoid was built by
A.I.M., an organization devoted to conquering
the world, as a secret weapon. It was originally
programmed to seek out and destroy Captain
America, and has battled him and the Avengers
on several occasions.

'BIlents: The Ringmaster has a Reason of Excellent
in electronics. He uses this talent to do
maintenance on his hat and to occasionally
build a device. He is not skilled enough to build
other complex electroniC devices.
Important People: The Ringmaster's only
friends are the performers of the Circus of
Crime. He has been jailed by the Avengers several
times.
Background: Maynard Tiboldt's parents were
circus owners and Nazi spies in the United
States. By the end of World War II, Tiboldt's father
had changed sides; he testified against the
Nazis, and for that he and his wife were assassinated
by Nazi fugitives. Maynard inherited the
circus, but business was so bad that he turned
to crime. Heconstructed his hat by adapting the
design of the null?tron, 'which once belonged to

to targets up to 4 areas away.
TRACTOR BEAMS. His fingers have Remarkably
strong powers that attract objects to him
from up to 10 areas away.
POWER ABSORBER. This device was designed

OTHER DEVICES. Ultron is always building
new weapons and devices to aid him in his conquest
ofthe world. Sometimes they are built into
his body, but usually not. Altering his body is difficult,
so he usually makes separate machines.
Important People: Ultron hates Henry Pym, his
creator. By association, he is not fond of the
Avengers. He copied the Wasp's mind into a r0-
bot body, Jocasta, intending it to be his bride.
But Jocasta spurneq him, so he hates her, too.
He has an overriding hate of all organic creatures.
He teamed up with Maximus at one time.
Background: Created by Henry Pym (Goliath),
Ultron was accidentally given artificial creative
intelligence. The robot developed an irrational
hatred of Pym and escaped after defeating him.
In each of the bodies it has occupied since then,
Ultron has attempted to kill Henry Pym, the
Avengers and all human life, in that order. He
originally built the Vision and Jocasta as elements
of plots to destroy the Avengers.
weapon master, all martial arts, wrestling, and
piloting.
PREDICTION ABILITY. The Taskmaster can
predict the actions of anyone he has studied. In
each round he attempts to do so, he makes an
Intuition FEAT roll for every opponent that he
knows of in the vicinity. If the roll is successful,
he does not have to decide what to do in that
r?und until after the hero or heroes have declared
their actions.
Any hero whom he has studied fights against
the Taskmaster at two column shifts to the left. If
the hero surprises him, this column shift does
not apply.
Equipment/Possessions: The Taskmaster carries
a steel alloy throwing shield, a bow with
some special arrows, a steel alloy sword, a multipurpose
billy club, and a .45 caliber automatic
pistol.
He also has a variety of small common devices,
such as magnesium flares, that he uses
as desired.
Important People: He has no known relatives
or friends. As a rule, he does not bear grudges.
Background: The Taskmaster's photographic
reflexes became evident during his childhood.
He used the power for minor personal gains at
first, and when he reached adulthood he turned
to a life of crime. For a time he used his wide
range of skills as a trainer of aspiring criminals,
hoping to become a supplier of talent to the underworld.
His training centers were all eventually
discovered and shut down.

The Combat Simulator incorporates
several constantly-modified devices
which serve to keep our heroes' reflexes
keen. They include large-scale destruction
(falling, thrown, ruptured and explosive
objects in the 1 ,000 lb. to 3 ton range) and
small-scale complications (flying, grasping,
running and articulated objects in the
30 lb. to 1 ,500 lb. range). The CS Room is
monitored and motivated by the main
computer in the Sub-Basement.
